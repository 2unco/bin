[View site on GitHub Pages](https://bilalakil.github.io/bin)

This is a static HTML site with a bunch of random implementations and examples.

- Double click or `open index.html` and navigate around to see the examples.
- Because there's no tooling involved here
  you can even play with this code and view the changes on mobile devices,
  i.e. with [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/)!
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) works out the box with plain sites,
  and by extension so does [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
