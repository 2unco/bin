[View site on GitHub Pages](https://bilalakil.github.io/bin)

This is a plain, static HTML site, with various minimal code samples arising from questions or discussions.

- Double click or `open index.html` and navigate around to see the examples.
- Look at the corresponding source code (which has comments to assist in explanations)
  and try changing things around yourself to see what happens.
- Because there's no tooling involved here,
  you can even play with this code and view the changes on mobile devices,
  i.e. with [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/)!
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) works out the box with plain sites,
  and by extension so does [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
